{"content":"Great question! Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. They consist of two numbers: the numerator and the denominator. \n\n- The **numerator** (the top number) tells you how many parts you have.\n- The **denominator** (the bottom number) tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n\nFor example, if you have a pizza that is cut into 8 equal slices and you eat 3 of those slices, you can represent what you ate as a fraction: \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\). Here, 3 is the numerator (the slices you ate), and 8 is the denominator (the total slices).\n\nFractions can also be used to show how to multiply parts together! For example, if you wanted to multiply \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) by \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), you would multiply the numerators (1 × 2 = 2) and the denominators (3 × 5 = 15), giving you a result of \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\). This is explained in the lesson on Multiplying Fractions (Grade 5, Mathematics) that you might find useful.\n\nIf you have more questions about fractions or how to work with them, just let me know!","sources":[{"id":3,"title":"Multiplying Fractions","grade":5,"subject":"Mathematics","documentType":"lesson_plan"}]}
